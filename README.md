# Insurance Risk Analysis (In Progress)

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing insurance data to identify patterns in claim risks, premium pricing, and potential fraud indicators. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that support underwriting decisions, reduce claim-related losses, and improve customer segmentation strategies.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn)
- SQL (PostgreSQL for querying datasets)
- Tableau / Power BI (for interactive dashboards)
- Excel (for initial data cleaning and analysis)

## Project Goals
- Analyze customer demographics and claim history
- Identify high-risk profiles using exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build a simple risk scoring model
- Visualize trends and risk factors over time

## Current Status
*This project is currently in development.*  
Milestones completed:
- Dataset identified and pre-cleaned
- Initial EDA in Python started
- Draft of visual dashboard layout planned

## Next Steps
- Complete data cleaning
- Develop risk scoring methodology
- Build dashboard for stakeholder presentation
